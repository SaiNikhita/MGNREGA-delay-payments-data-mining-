# MGNREGA-delay-payments-using-machine-learning
Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) is one of the schemes implemented by the government of India in keeping mind that â€œThe soul of India lives in its villages", Most of the people in the rural part of the country are depending on the unskilled manual works for their survival. Many works have been done early in the process of criticizing the positive and negative impacts of this scheme. All works has some limitations such as it lack in the intelligent prediction, and to use suitable technique for the research, that motivates us to take up this specific scheme. This work is analyzing the potholes in this system.
	I am motivated to do this project so that our final analysis may result in the proper implementation of this act without any delay of payment,where the workers get to know rejected reasons of delay compensation so that their hard work does'nt go in vain and the officials get to know the reasons behind payment delays and be more careful in future.
